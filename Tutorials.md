This page will host various video tutorials covering modding with MES that I publish over time.

[**Creating a Simple Cargo Ship Mod**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpMbBkQurzY)  
This tutorial covers the very basics of setting up a mod folder, exporting a ship, and setting up a SpawnGroup file. This is a great section to start with if you have no NPC modding experience.

[**Creating a Planetary Installation Mod**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHcYS82kQog)  
This tutorial covers how to create a Planetary Installation encounter that will appear as players explore the planet surface. While it does cover how to create a mod folder, less detail is covered than in the first video in this series.
