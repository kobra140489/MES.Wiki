SpawnGroups are definitions that provide rules about an NPC encounter to the Modular Encounters Systems Spawning Mechanism.

The SpawnGroups that the Modular Encounters Systems uses utilize the `<Description>` tags to define many custom rules and modifications to a spawned entity. This includes conditions for when the encounter is allowed to spawn, and manipulations that are applied to the prefabs (grids) before they are spawned into the world.
